Due to dependencies, please run the SQL files in the below order only:

“Project_ER_Schema” this file is used to create the schema. 

1. state_lockdown_details
2. county_details
3. station_details
4. fips_daily_cases
5. daily_weather_details
6. county_socio_health

Tables Draft has to be updated with very slight changes like foreign keys and primary keys which would be evident from looking at the ER Schema. Please do not alter any Data Types to names as everything is already designed and processed.
